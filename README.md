# 🥧 Language Distribution

| Language | Usage | Primary Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| 🐍 Python | ~40% | Algo trading, ML, data analysis |
| ⚙️ C++ | ~35% | Exchange systems, low-latency trading engines |
| 📓 Jupyter Notebook | ~10% | ML experimentation, CNN models |
| 🔷 TypeScript | ~8% | Frontend development with Angular |
| 🔵 C / C# | ~5% | Systems programming, supplementary tooling |
| 🖥️ Bash | ~2% | Scripting & automation |

> The split reflects a dual focus: **Python** for rapid prototyping and ML, **C++** for production-grade, performance-critical systems.

# 🚀 Featured Projects

### [algo_trading](https://github.com/Jamesfryer1998/algo_trading) — Python
A full-featured **algorithmic trading platform** built in Python. Provides a framework for implementing, backtesting, and running various trading strategies in live and simulated market conditions. Designed with modularity in mind so strategies can be swapped, tested, and compared easily.

**Key highlights:**
- Pluggable strategy architecture
- Backtesting engine with historical data support
- Live trading integration
- Performance reporting and analytics

---

### [C-Crypto-Platform](https://github.com/Jamesfryer1998/C-Crypto-Platform) — C++
A **text-based cryptocurrency trading simulator** built entirely in C++. Users can interactively buy and sell simulated cryptocurrencies through a terminal interface, demonstrating core C++ concepts including OOP, data structures, and memory management in a finance context.

**Key highlights:**
- Real-time simulated price feeds
- Interactive CLI trading interface
- Portfolio tracking and P&L display
- Built with core C++ and STL — no external dependencies

---

### [BrainTumourDetection](https://github.com/Jamesfryer1998/BrainTumourDetection) — Python / Jupyter
A **deep learning project** that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect brain tumours from MRI scans. Trained on a labelled dataset of magnetic resonance images, the model classifies whether a tumour is present — demonstrating applied ML in a medical imaging context.

**Key highlights:**
- CNN architecture built with TensorFlow/Keras
- Trained on real MRI image datasets
- Image preprocessing and augmentation pipeline
- Accuracy metrics, confusion matrix, and visual results

---

### ⚡ [Cpp-Exchange](https://github.com/Jamesfryer1998/Cpp-Exchange) — C++
A **low-latency order book and exchange engine** built in C++. This project simulates the core mechanics of a financial exchange — order matching, book management, and trade execution — with a focus on performance and correctness.

**Key highlights:**
- Limit order book with bid/ask matching
- Order types: market, limit, cancel
- High-performance design using C++ data structures
- Foundation for building a full trading venue

---

### [Arbitrage](https://github.com/Jamesfryer1998/Arbitrage) — Python
A **crypto arbitrage detection and execution tool** written in Python. Monitors price discrepancies across exchanges or trading pairs and identifies opportunities for risk-free profit through simultaneous buy/sell execution.

**Key highlights:**
- Multi-exchange price monitoring
- Arbitrage opportunity detection logic
- Execution simulation
- Designed to be extended with live API integrations

---

### [C-AlgoTrader](https://github.com/Jamesfryer1998/C-AlgoTrader) — C++
A **high-performance algorithmic trading engine** written in C++. Focuses on the execution layer of algorithmic trading — order management, signal processing, and trade lifecycle — built for speed and reliability at the systems level.

**Key highlights:**
- Signal-driven order execution
- Order and position management
- Low-latency C++ design patterns
- Complements the Python algo_trading project at the infrastructure level
